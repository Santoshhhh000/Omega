<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have good observation skills and always solution oriented approach in life. I do get nervous and have fears 
  but to euphoria that follows overcoming it is quite addictive. I am disciplined sicne schooldays, I don't know 
  why? A social animal, always helping if I had effective solutions. Rest yor are the experts, and I acknowledge 
  your analysis.
